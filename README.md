Railway Database Management System

This Railway Database Management System is a SQL plus database model enhanced with Java GUI
application designed to automate the operations of managing a railway database system. It contains
various aspects such as ticket booking, train scheduling, passenger information management, fare
calculation and more. This system aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for both
railway administrators and passengers.

Key Components of the Railway Database Management System:

Ticket Booking: The system allows passengers to search for trains, check seat availability, and book
tickets online. It provides a convenient way for passengers to select their preferred train, class, and
seat.

Train Scheduling: The system manages the scheduling of trains, including their departure and arrival
times, source and destination stations, and intermediate stops. It ensures proper coordination and
optimization of train routes to minimize delays and maximize efficiency.

Passenger Information Management: The system maintains a database of passenger details,
including their names, ages, genders, and contact information. It facilitates the management of
passenger records, ticket cancellations, and modifications.

Fare Calculation: The system calculates the fare for different train routes based on class of travel. It
ensures accurate fare calculation and provides transparent pricing information to passengers.

Train and Class Management: The system manages the information related to trains and their
coaches. It keeps track of the train's capacity, coach types (e.g., sleeper, AC, general), and the number
of available seats in each coach. This allows efficient allocation of seats during the booking process.

Automated Interface: The system includes a Java-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) that
provides an easy-to-use platform for interacting with the database. The GUI presents a layout with
organized menus, buttons, and forms, making it user-friendly for users.
